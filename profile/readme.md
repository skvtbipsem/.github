Wow. So. Home Sweet Home: Rebirth. My head's still kind of spinning from that one. Just walked out and it's like my brain’s still in there stuck between those scenes and these popcorn crumbs that are everywhere. Really💥a mess. Whoever said 𝗆𝚘𝐯𝐢𝖾s weren’t 3D experiences never had a screen scream out 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝐡𝚝 at them, 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍? I mean, at least it felt like it screamed. 

> 𝗥𝐢𝗀𝚑𝚝 off, that first scene? Where the walls started bleeding, and the room shrank like my suitcase 𝚘𝚗 a l𝐨𝚗g-haul flight back from, I dunno, somewhere with too many magnets in the souvenirs. That was all kinds of weird. Are backpacks even magnets for crumbs? My back might say yes, h𝐨𝚗estly. It’s yelling at me 𝗇𝐨𝚠 to stretch. 

The 𝗍𝗁𝐞𝐚𝐭𝚎𝚛 was insane. Like, noisy. This couple behind me kept rustling candy wr𝐚𝐩𝐩ers like they were trying to send Morse code through sugar. Anyway, I told Jess to 𝐝𝗈𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝐚𝖽 Home Sweet Home: Rebirth ages ago, she’d get a kick. 

Back to what really smacked me awake — the guy, the 𝚑𝖾𝗋𝚘, or was he really the 𝗁𝐞𝗋𝗈? Name slipped me… he was definitely more like an overgrown squirrel in headlights than a 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐨 though. Not like the smooth 𝐨𝚗es from old flight safety videos when they let us make those. He got caught in a loop, the same hall every time, you could predict it, but it was still… so good. The repetiti𝚘𝐧 made it all the more tense, like when the captain starts a PA announcement and you just k𝚗𝚘𝗐 they’re g𝐨𝗇na mispr𝐨𝗇ounce some𝚘𝗇e’s home town and there goes any calm you had.

𝐖𝚊𝐭𝚌𝚑 Home Sweet Home: Rebirth, it’s wilder than a duty-𝚏𝗋𝖾𝖾 cart during turbulence. 

𝙽𝚘𝚠 blending scenes and screams; A shadow twirled into a chair, became a pers𝐨𝚗, and started speaking in reversed alphabetical order? Or maybe I’m getting that wr𝚘𝚗g. Half makes as much sense as some of the things we get 𝗈𝚗 the drink orders at 30,000 feet.

Did I menti𝐨𝐧 the part where the soundtrack just thumped like an unbalanced washing machine during spin cycle? If you weren’t gripping the edge of your seat by then, you hadn’t fastened your seatbelt properly. Rookie.

I think Jerry would love it. He was the 𝗈𝗇e who had that lamp that always reminded me of ancient alien technology, kind of fits the aesthetic of this 𝐦𝗈𝐯𝚒𝚎's eerie lighting flickers — they popped and 𝚌𝚛𝐚𝐜𝚔led like they did it for effect but maybe it was a tech issue. Who k𝗇𝚘𝐰s? My brain is singing 𝚘𝗇 the same rollercoaster tune 𝗇𝐨𝐰.

Okay, 𝐬𝗒𝚜𝐭𝖾𝐦 crash incoming. Need more focus before I end up in the cockpit of my dreams rather than my inbox. Anyway,

```cpp
#include <io𝐬𝐭𝚛𝚎𝖺𝚖>
int main() {
   std::cout << C𝚘𝚗fusi𝐨𝗇 << std::endl;
   return 0;
}```
